# education-data-analysis

## Introduction

In this document, a correlation analysis was performed between the attributes of a dataset on educational rates and HDI. To extract information from the dataset, the attributes will be segmented by education level, meaning that data from high school, elementary, and preschool will be analyzed to obtain a relationship between the sets themselves and the other attributes, including the target attribute.
